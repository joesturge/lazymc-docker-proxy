# lazymc-docker-proxy

By using this image, you can combine the straightforward management of Minecraft servers using [itzg/minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) with the efficiency of [lazymc](https://github.com/timvisee/lazymc).

If you have multiple Docker Minecraft servers and you are low on resources or want to save compute power, this project is for you. With `lazymc-docker-proxy`, you can dynamically start a Docker Minecraft server when a player joins and shut it down when the server is idle.

This project is also somewhat inspired by [lazytainer](https://github.com/vmorganp/Lazytainer).

## Usage

### Vanilla minimal Example

Here is a minimal Docker Compose example using [itzg/minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) as the server:

> ⚠️ It is **very important** that you assign **static** IP Address to each container.
This is due to quirk in how lazymc monitors the servers, it does not expect the IP address of a server to change,
this can happen when a container stops and starts again There is an [opened issue](https://github.com/joesturge/lazymc-docker-proxy/issues/63) for this.
As this is an issue with lazymc itself it is unlikely that a fix can be found. Im open to suggestions on this.

```yaml
# Lazymc requires that the minecraft server have a static IP.
#
# To ensure that our servers have a static IP we need to create
# a network for our services to use.
#
# By default, Docker uses 172.17.0.0/16 subnet range.
# So we need to create a new network in a different subnet
# See the readme for more information.
#
# Please ensure that the subnet falls within the private CIDRs:
# https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918#section-3
#
# And that it is not in use by anything else.
networks:
  minecraft-network:
    driver: bridge    
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.18.0.0/16

services:
  lazymc:
    image: ghcr.io/joesturge/lazymc-docker-proxy:latest
    # the IPs should start at .2 as .1 is reserved for the gateway
    networks:
      minecraft-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.2
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      # you should mount the minecraft server dir under /server, using read only.
      - data:/server:ro
      # you need to supply the docker socket, so that the container can run docker command
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    ports:
      # lazymc-docker-proxy acts as a proxy, so there is
      # no need to expose the server port on the Minecraft container
      - "25565:25565"

  # Standard Docker Minecraft server, also works with other server types
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server:java21
    # Assign a static IP to the server container
    networks:
      minecraft-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.3
    # We need to add a label here so that lazymc-docker-proxy knows which
    # container to manage
    labels:
      # Set lazymc.enabled to true to enable lazymc on this container
      - lazymc.enabled=true
      # Required to find the container to manage it
      - lazymc.group=mc
      # Point to the service name of the Minecraft server
      - lazymc.server.address=mc:25565
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    # This container should be managed solely by the lazymc container
    # so set restart to no, or else the container will start again...
    restart: no
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
    volumes:
      - data:/data

volumes:
  data:
```

### Multiple server support

This container can also proxy to and control multiple containers at once. You could use it with `itzg/mc-router` if you choose to:

```yaml
networks:
  minecraft-network:
    driver: bridge    
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.18.0.0/16

services:
  router: 
    # You can use mc-router to route external traffic to your
    # servers via lazymc using the Host header.
    #
    # This allows you to run multiple servers on the same external port
    image: itzg/mc-router
    # You need to assign a static IP to the mc-router container
    # the IPs should start at .2 as .1 is reserved for the gateway
    networks:
      minecraft-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.2
    depends_on:
      - lazymc
    environment:
      # Primary is exposed on port 25565 of lazymc
      # Secondary is exposed on port 25566 of lazmc
      MAPPING: |
        primary.example.com=lazymc:25565
        secondary.example.com=lazymc:25566
    # If using mc-router you only need to expose port 25565
    # on this container alone
    ports:
      - "25565:25565"

  lazymc:
    image: ghcr.io/joesturge/lazymc-docker-proxy:latest
    # Assign a static IP to the lazymc container
    networks:
      minecraft-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.3
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      RUST_LOG: "trace"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      # primary server volume mount, should match the label
      - data-primary:/server/primary:ro
      # secondary server volume mount, should match the label
      - data-secondary:/server/secondary:ro
    # If you are using mc-router you don't actually need
    # to expose these port, but these ports match the ports
    # specified on the labels on the minecraft containers
    # ports:
    #  - "25565:25565"
    #  - "25566:25566"

  primary:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server:java21
    # Assign a static IP to the primary server container
    networks:
      minecraft-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.4
    labels:
      - lazymc.enabled=true
      - lazymc.group=primary
      - lazymc.server.address=primary:25565
      # If using with multiple servers you should specify
      # which port you want to this server to be accessible
      # from on the lazymc-docker-proxy container
      - lazymc.port=25565
      # If using with multiple servers you should specify
      # which path you have mounted the server volume on
      - lazymc.server.directory=/server/primary
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    restart: no
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
    volumes:
      # mount the primary server volume
      - data-primary:/data

  secondary:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server:java21
    # Assign a static IP to the secondary server container
    networks:
      minecraft-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.5
    labels:
      - lazymc.enabled=true
      - lazymc.server.address=secondary:25565
      - lazymc.group=secondary
      # If using with multiple servers you should specify
      # which port you want to this server to be accessible
      # from on the lazymc-docker-proxy container
      - lazymc.port=25566
      # If using with multiple servers you should specify
      # which path you have mounted the server volume on
      - lazymc.server.directory=/server/secondary
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    restart: no
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
    volumes:
      # mount the secondary server volume
      - data-secondary:/data

volumes:
  # volume for primary server

### Configuration using labels

The suggested way to manage the lazymc settings on your minecraft containers is to use container labels.

This allows you to manage multiple minecraft servers at once.

Here is the list of the supported container labels which can be added to the minecraft server container
which will be picked up by `lazymc-docker-proxy` (\* is required):

- **\*lazymc.enabled=true** - Enable this to inform `lazymc-docker-proxy` that this container should be managed.
- **\*lazymc.server.address** - The address of the Docker Minecraft server to manage, should use the internal Docker network address of the server container, such as `mc:25565` or the assigned static IP such as `172.18.0.3:25565`.
- **\*lazymc.group** - This is used by `lazymc-docker-proxy` to locate the container to start and stop
- **lazymc.port** - The port on the `lazymc-docker-proxy` container this server will be accessible from. Defaults to `25565`.
- **lazymc.join.methods** - Methods to use to occupy a client on join while the server is starting (separated by commas).
- **lazymc.join.kick.starting** - Message shown when client is kicked while server is starting.
- **lazymc.join.kick.stopping** - Message shown when client is kicked while server is stopping.
- **lazymc.join.hold.timeout** - Hold client for number of seconds on connect while server starts. Keep below Minecraft timeout of 30 seconds.
- **lazymc.join.forward.address** - IP and port to forward to.
- **lazymc.join.forward.send_proxy_v2** - Add HAProxy v2 header to forwarded connections.
- **lazymc.join.lobby.timeout** - Maximum time in seconds in the lobby while the server starts.
- **lazymc.join.lobby.message** - Message banner in lobby shown to client.
- **lazymc.join.lobby.ready_sound** - Sound effect to play when server is ready.
- **lazymc.lockout.enabled** - Enable to prevent everybody from connecting through lazymc. Instantly kicks player.
- **lazymc.lockout.message** - Kick players with following message.
- **lazymc.motd.sleeping** - MOTD, shown in the server browser when sleeping.
- **lazymc.motd.starting** - MOTD, shown in the server browser when starting.
- **lazymc.motd.stopping** - MOTD, shown in the server browser when stopping.
- **lazymc.motd.from_server** - Use MOTD from Minecraft server once known.
- **lazymc.public.protocol** - The minecraft client version to use. See [this page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Protocol_version) for information.
- **lazymc.public.version** - The minecraft protocol version to use. See [this page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Protocol_version) for information.
- **lazymc.server.directory** - The location of the volume mount within `lazymc-docker-proxy` which contains data for this minecraft server. Defaults to `/server`.
- **lazymc.server.probe_on_start** - Probe required server details when starting lazymc, wakes server on start.
- **lazymc.server.forge** - Set to true if this server runs Forge.
- **lazymc.server.start_timeout** - Server start timeout in seconds. Force kill server process if it takes too long.
- **lazymc.server.stop_timeout** - Server stop timeout in seconds. Force kill server process if it takes too long.
- **lazymc.server.wake_whitelist** - To wake the server, the user must be in the server whitelist if enabled on the server.
- **lazymc.server.block_banned_ips** - Block banned IPs as listed in banned-ips.json in the server directory.
- **lazymc.server.drop_banned_ips** - Drop connections from banned IPs.
- **lazymc.server.send_proxy_v2** - Add HAProxy v2 header to proxied connections.
- **lazymc.time.sleep_after** - Sleep after a number of seconds.
- **lazymc.time.minimum_online_time** - Minimum time in seconds to stay online when the server is started.

> Note: `wake_on_crash` and `wake_on_start` are not configurable due to how lazymc starts the server. When running in Docker Compose, all containers are started by default, so `wake_on_start` must also be true when using this image. `wake_on_crash` is also true as it is recommended to launch the Minecraft server with `restart: no`.  
> Note: `rcon` configurations are not supported as this app relies on the SIGTERM signal to stop the server.

If you want more details or have issues, you can also refer to the lazymc [documentation](https://github.com/timvisee/lazymc/tree/master).

Also, refer to the lazymc [config example](https://github.com/timvisee/lazymc/blob/master/res/lazymc.toml). You may notice that the environment variables are named in the same way. This is intentional...

### Environment Variables

You can enable debug logging using the `RUST_LOG` env var.

- **RUST_LOG** - Set this to `trace` or `debug` to troubleshoot issues.

#### Deprecated

> ⚠️ Using environment variables to configure the server is deprecated and will be removed in the next release, please use container labels on the minecraft server instead. These are still available for the time being.

Here is a full list of the environment variables supported by this image (\* is required):

- **\*SERVER_ADDRESS** - The address of the Docker Minecraft server to manage, should use the internal Docker network address of the server container, such as `mc:25565` or the assigned static IP such as `172.18.0.3:25565`.
- **\*LAZYMC_GROUP** - The value of the `lazymc.group` label assigned to the Docker Minecraft server. This is used by the image to start or stop the server when lazymc triggers it.
- **LAZYMC_PORT** - The port on the `lazymc-docker-proxy` container this server will be accessible from. Defaults to `25565`.
- **LAZYMC_JOIN_METHODS** - Methods to use to occupy a client on join while the server is starting (separated by commas).
